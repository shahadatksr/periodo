# Periodo.

A simple flutter app to display the Periodic table elements and their properties. 

# App Demo 

![](demo.gif)

- For fetching the details of each element I used this [elements.json](https://github.com/shahadatksr/periodo/blob/master/Elements/elements_json.json) file and converted it into a Dart Class. You can check out the Data Model here: [ElementsProvider.dart](https://github.com/shahadatksr/periodo/blob/master/lib/models/ElementsProvider.dart
) 
- For the animations I used the Hero widget

The JSON file I used in the app was taken from the [Periodic-Table-JSON](https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON) by [Bowserinator](https://github.com/Bowserinator)
